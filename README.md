## Composable NFT with integrated AAve.(Kovan)

The dapp has two functions for nesting ERC20 token in NFT.
1) Normal MYERC20 token(It will not provide any interest).
2) Aave supported token(We have used sUsd token for nesting into the NFT and getting interest using Aave protocol).

For using Aave interest model, you need to have sUsd token, you can borrow it from here [Aave Market](https://app.aave.com/) using kovan testnet ether.
You can learn more about Aave testing market [here](https://docs.aave.com/faq/testing-aave).
